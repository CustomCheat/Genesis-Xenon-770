# Genesis-Xenon-770
This is unofficial software for the Genesis Xenon 770 mouse for GNU/Linux. For now with little functionality (only RGB controls), but I want to add the DPI controls and later macro controls. You can see some macro controls in the main.py, but its not implemented yet in the GUI and may be buggy.

# How to use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python3 gui.py
```
