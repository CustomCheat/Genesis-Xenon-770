# Genesis-Xenon-770
This is unofficial software for the Genesis Xenon 770 mouse for GNU/Linux. For now with little functionality (only RGB, DPI controls), but I want to add macro controls. You can see some macro controls in the main.py, but its not implemented yet in the GUI and may be buggy.

# How to use:
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
sudo python3 gui.py
```
## Make sure to run as root! It cannot attach to the mouse without root!

# TODO:
- Add mouse parameter settings
- Add poling rate settings
- Add macros
- Add profiles
